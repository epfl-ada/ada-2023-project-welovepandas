# Beers Across the Atlantic: Decoding Beer Preferences in North America and Europe

## Abstract
The North American and European markets are of great significance to the global beer industry. They influence the trends that are followed by the industry. Thus, it was our curiosity about these two markets of beer that made us conduct this study in order to understand various tastes and inclinations of their customers to be able to analyse the beer industry within these regions.

The objective of the study is examining beer preference patterns between America and Europe. Hence, it has been planned to be done in a period of seventeen years from 2000-2017.
We are primarily interested in establishing whether there is significant disparity in preference for beers with high alcohol by volume (ABV) between North Americans and Europeans, and if this preference is linked to certain types of beers.The reason behind our interest lies in cultural disparities in alcohol drinking as well as the need for a better comprehension of how trends take place in the global beer industry.

Therefore, different methods will be utilised so as to link beer ratings and properties with alcohol percentages in order to develop an interesting narrative that demonstrates how tastes have changed over time.
This research will then provide insightful information for product development and marketing strategies of the beer sector.

## Research Questions
### 1. Do Americans prefer beers with a higher alcohol content (ABV) than Europeans?
This delves into whether N. Americans favor higher alcohol content beers compared to Europeans. In order to investigate this question, we will analyse ratings from both datasets, grouping users based on their location.  
### 2. Is there a correlation between this preference and specific beer styles known for higher ABV?
We will use grouping techniques and micro/macro averages to analyse this preference.
### 3. How have beer preferences, especially in terms of ABV, evolved in America and Europe between 2000 and 2017?
To analyse this question, we will use time series analysis and visualisation techniques.
### 4. Is it possible to map American states to European countries based on similarities in beer preferences?
How can graph and network algorithms be utilized to explore these geographical correlations?
### 5. As we know that health consciousness increased in recent years, we want to explore if there is a noticeable shift in beer preferences towards lower ABV options.

## Datasets
**BeerAdvocate** and **RateBeers**

## Methods
- **Data preprocessing**
**Data Filtering:** Not all features will be useful, therefore, we will filter the data to remove irrelevant or redundant information
**Grouping:** Grouping data based on relevant features (location, beer style)
**Data visualisation:** To better understand the data and define next steps

- **Time Series Analysis**
This method involves examining beer ratings and reviews over time, allowing us to track changes in preferences for beer styles or characteristics.

- **Trend Analysis** 
We will study the data to identify patterns that may indicate emerging preferences or declining interest in specific beer styles.

- **Regression Analysis**
This statistical technique will be employed for both trend and time series analysis to quantify relationships between preferences of users from NA and EU.

- **Data Visualization** 
We will create charts and graphs to help users and breweries visualize beer prefrences, and trends among parameters.

- **GEO plot**
Interconnect NA states with EU contries based on their the most desired beer style.
